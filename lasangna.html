		<p><b>There are many different variations of lasagna. Ancient Rome had a similar dish called "lasanum" which means container/pot in Latin. Another variation of lasagna is "Lasagna alla Norma", which is from Sicily, Italy. Many kinds of pasta in Sicily have eggplant. This dish includes roasted eggplants, ricotta salata cheese, tomato, sauce and basil. Another type of lasagna is called Lasagna alla Genovese which is from the city of Genoa. The city of Genoa is famous for its pesto. Their lasagna has a sauce called ragu sauce (which is a meat-type sauce, however, the actual dish does not include meat ), and includes pesto sauce. </b></p>
