		<h3>History</h3>
		<p><b>Pizza was invented in Southwestern Italy. Which was home to the Naples
(<i>A city in Italy, which is now called Campania</i>). It consists of flatbread, which was largely consumed by Egyptians, Romans, and Greeks. People soon started adding oil and herbs. It was soon founded in 200 B.C. by Naples during poverty. Naples needed inexpensive food, which could be consumed quickly. They put toppings on flatbread and were old in vendors. 
After, Italian immigrants brought it to other countries, which caused the actual “discovery” of pizza.
